# Lily Text-to-speech
Hi there! This is a hobby project I created to experiment with converting print and kindle books into audiobooks using cloud services like [Azure Cognitive Services](https://azure.microsoft.com/en-us/services/cognitive-services/text-to-speech/) and [Amazon Polly](https://aws.amazon.com/polly/).

The project primarily consists of a Java command line program that I can run to do various useful things, like coverting a long text file pulled from a book scan into high quality MP3 files (including the appropriate pauses between parapgraphs, sections, and chapters), or processing the raw text I get from [Tesseract](https://github.com/tesseract-ocr/tesseract) to remove line breaks.

This project and the audio I produce with it are designed for personal use only. The code may be rough or non-functional.
